### Linux File Hierarchy Structure (FHS)

The Linux File Hierarchy Structure (FHS) defines the directory structure and contents of the Linux filesystem. Below is a table summarizing the key directories and their specifications.

### Description of Key Directories

1. **/ (Root)**  
   - Every file and directory starts from the root directory.  
   - Only the root user has write privileges under this directory.  
   - `/root` is the root userâ€™s home directory, which is not the same as `/`.

2. **/bin (User Binaries)**  
   - Contains binary executables.  
   - Common Linux commands are located here.  
   - Examples: `ps`, `ls`, `ping`, `grep`, `cp`.

3. **/sbin (System Binaries)**  
   - Contains system binaries, used by system administrators for maintenance.  
   - Examples: `iptables`, `reboot`, `fdisk`, `ifconfig`, `swapon`.

4. **/etc (Configuration Files)**  
   - Contains configuration files for all programs and system startup/shutdown scripts.  
   - Examples: `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/logrotate.conf`.

5. **/dev (Device Files)**  
   - Contains device files representing hardware devices.  
   - Examples: `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/usbmon0`.

6. **/proc (Process Information)**  
   - A pseudo filesystem with information about running processes.  
   - Examples: `/proc/{pid}`, `/proc/uptime`.

7. **/var (Variable Files)**  
   - Contains files that are expected to grow, such as system logs, databases, and email files.  
   - Examples: `/var/log`, `/var/mail`, `/var/spool`, `/var/tmp`.

8. **/tmp (Temporary Files)**  
   - Stores temporary files created by the system and users.  
   - Files in this directory are deleted after reboot.

9. **/usr (User Programs)**  
   - Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source code for second-level programs.  
   - Example directories: `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local`.

10. **/home (Home Directories)**  
    - Contains personal directories for users.  
    - Example: `/home/john`, `/home/nikita`.

11. **/boot (Boot Loader Files)**  
    - Contains files necessary for booting the system, including the kernel and boot loader files.  
    - Examples: `vmlinuz`, `initrd.img`.

12. **/lib (System Libraries)**  
    - Contains libraries that support binaries located in `/bin` and `/sbin`.  
    - Examples: `ld-2.11.1.so`, `libncurses.so.5.7`.

13. **/opt (Optional Add-on Applications)**  
    - Contains add-on applications from third-party vendors.  
    - Example: `/opt/apache2`.

14. **/mnt (Mount Directory)**  
    - A temporary mount directory where system administrators mount filesystems.

15. **/media (Removable Media Devices)**  
    - A temporary mount directory for removable devices.  
    - Examples: `/media/cdrom`, `/media/usb`.

16. **/srv (Service Data)**  
    - Contains data related to services provided by the system.  
    - Example: `/srv/www` for web server data.

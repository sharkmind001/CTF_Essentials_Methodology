# CTF Essentials Methodology

Capture the Flag (CTF) events are a cornerstone of cybersecurity training and challenge-based learning. The **CTF Essentials Methodology** refers to a structured approach to solving challenges in CTF competitions, whether they are Jeopardy-style, Attack-Defend, or Mixed formats.

---

## 1. Preparation
- **Tools Setup:**
  - Install essential tools (e.g., Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, John the Ripper, etc.).
  - Familiarize yourself with common tools like `nmap`, `gobuster`, and `sqlmap`.
- **Environment:**
  - Use a secure and isolated machine (preferably a virtual machine like Kali Linux or Parrot Security OS).
  - Update software and tools to the latest versions.
- **Learning Resources:**
  - Study past CTF challenges.
  - Learn fundamental topics like networking, web security, reverse engineering, and cryptography.

---

## 2. Challenge Identification
- **Understand the Rules:**
  - Read the challenge description and scoring rules carefully.
- **Categorization:**
  - Categorize challenges into domains like Web, Forensics, Crypto, Reverse Engineering, OSINT, or Binary Exploitation.

---

## 3. Reconnaissance
- **Passive Recon:**
  - Gather public information using tools like `theHarvester`, `Shodan`, and `Google Dorks`.
- **Active Recon:**
  - Use scanning tools (e.g., `nmap`, `nikto`) to find open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

---

## 4. Exploitation
- Depending on the challenge:
  - **Web Challenges:**
    - Look for vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, or insecure deserialization.
  - **Crypto Challenges:**
    - Analyze ciphers and attempt known-plaintext attacks or brute force.
  - **Reverse Engineering:**
    - Use tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, or radare2.
  - **Forensics:**
    - Examine files with `strings`, `binwalk`, or `ExifTool`.
- Leverage custom scripts or exploits when necessary.

---

## 5. Collaboration
- Work with team members:
  - Share findings and insights.
  - Divide tasks to maximize efficiency.
- Use communication tools like Slack, Discord, or private IRC channels.

---

## 6. Flag Submission
- Carefully check the format of the flag.
- Submit it via the CTF platform and verify scoring.

---

## 7. Documentation
- Note down the approach, tools used, and steps taken.
- Document learnings for future reference.

---

## 8. Post-CTF Reflection
- Analyze performance:
  - Identify strengths and weaknesses.
- Participate in write-ups:
  - Share solutions with the community (if permitted).
- Improve skills based on challenges faced.
